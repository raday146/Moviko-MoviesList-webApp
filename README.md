# .Moviko-MoviesList-webApp
 
##Introduction  :rocket::rocket:
   A web app that contains a variety of summaries of a variety of movies as cards.
   The same films will be shown with ratings and year details, which will make it easier for the user to understand which film he would like to see in the cinema even before (according to the parameters presented) as suitable for him.
   The app will allow a number of movie filtering options, including movie search.
   The options that the web application allows the user to activate will be from the side menu.

# Status :monocle_face:
  This project is for educational purposes and personal curiosity. ðŸ™‚

# API
  for the project I used The Movie Database, fetching information about movies (API has great documentation). 

## Pagination

  Fetching the data (page) that contains all the information relevant to that page and its index and so on for the purpose of pulling the rest of the information until reaching the last page and thus pulling out all the information required for further necessary activity.

## Notes :partying_face:
   In addition it is possible to develop the concept of the app more as others have done in the past.
